The increase was primarily due to a $16.4 million increase in stock-based compensation and related employer payroll taxes, driven by the satisfaction of the performance vesting condition on outstanding RSUs in connection with the Direct Listing in June 2019. The increase was also driven by a $12.4 million increase in third-party hosting costs as the number of organizations on, and usage of, Slack in general increased, an $8.8 million increase in personnel costs related to increased headcount, and a $3.9 million increase in facility- and IT-related overhead costs to support our headcount growth and the continued development and scalability of Slack.'''"
